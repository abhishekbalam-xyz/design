Finally, after some considerable effort I finished making the framework for my own blog on design! :)

<!–-break-–>

## Why this blog?

I was always a fan of good design. It always fascinated me how wonderfully the arts and creative thinking was used to solve real world problems, with logical and technical  reasoning behind it.

From what I understand, Design is just about solving technical problems around usability and working of products, not just how it looks. This is why I like to observe how products are made, as each aspect of them involves meticulous thought put into making it usable not just functioning.

I really don't think I know enough about design and am no expert by any standards.And I dont intend to be. Im just an admirer.

Thus, I made this blog to note down my thoughts on design and what I observe around me. In all of its spirit this blog is a fan page for good products and a notepad for my musings on them.

## What will I post here ?

My posts here will be of the following types:

### 1. Observations

I will post about the instances of interesting design features on products I come across, be it apps, or daily commodities, or coding. All these posts will be be tagged as such.

### 2. Experiments

In these posts I will write with my experiences when faced with a design challenge and how I solved it. Usually when working on projects I focus on design alot because I believe product should be aesthetically appealing too, not just bare bones functionals.

### 3. Rants

I tend to have strong opinions about some stuff. This is where I get to let off steam , just kidding :P. Occasionally you might see posts about philosophy about life which I think should affect how things are made.

Thats about it, unless I come with more content.

Looking forward to start writing here :)
